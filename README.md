# ASP.Net Core Blazor Project

>An ASP.Net Core Client Side Blazor application is required which provides simple interactive functionality to display data from a public API and provide other simple features.
>A Single-Page Application is required implemented using Blazor (client side). 1/2 pages will suffice. The application should interact with a public API of your choice (GET only). The API should be RESTful (JSON), a public open API (with no authentication) is fine.

Public API Used: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

## Requirements:

> - Maybe the app show allow a search capability (e.g. input a city to see the weather forecast for the city), or sorting, or maybe a calculation of some sort (e.g. real-time currency conversion), depending on the topic chosen. Include validation on inputs.

> - Keep the UI clean and simple. Pay attention to code quality and metrics. Use Github to version control your project. Have regular commits to Github, no branching is required.

> - Host the application on Azure or any public cloud or hosting service of your choice. 


## Deliverables: 

> -	source code (ZIP).

> -	Short report (2/3 pages) containing a short description of system, screen shots, URI for deployed app, description of testing performed, code quality/metrics, Github repo URI.

> -	5 â€“ 10 minute video demo where you walk through the running application.
