# ASP.Net Core Blazor Project

>An ASP.Net Core Client Side Blazor application is required which provides simple interactive functionality to display data from a public API and provide other simple features.
>A Single-Page Application is required implemented using Blazor (client side). 1/2 pages will suffice. The application should interact with a public API of your choice (GET only). The API should be RESTful (JSON), a public open API (with no authentication) is fine.

Public API Used: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

 ## Deliverables: 

>•	source code (ZIP).

>•	Short report (2/3 pages) containing a short description of system, screen shots, URI for deployed app, description of testing performed, code quality/metrics, Github repo URI.

>•	5 – 10 minute video demo where you walk through the running application.
